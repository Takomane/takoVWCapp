            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Born and raised in what Omeretta the Great calls Atlanta, I went through APS and joined the military my senior year of High school. I pursued a bachelors of science in Criminal Justice. After graduating, started my adult career as a legal assistant and made it to paralegal, however I cannot see a future in it. I do have a side hustle, as most people do now a days, as an event DJ. My hobbies include live events, music and video games. In my free time I have been practicing HTML, and listening to the Atlanta United Games.</p>
