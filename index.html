            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Born and raised in what Omeretta the Great calls Atlanta, I went through APS and joined the military my senior year of High school. I pursued a bachelors of science in Criminal Justice. I started my adult career as a Legal Assistant and made it to Paralega, however it is not my passion, nor can I see a future in it. My hobbies include live events, music and video games. In my free time I have been practicing HTML, and listening to the Atlanta United Games.</p>

      <h2> Why I want to Learn Code</h2>

      <p>
        It is time for a change. Technology and coding has always been an interest of mine, but I doubted myself to be honest. It was my belief that going back to school would be the only way to make it happen, which I could not do financially. However, now knowing what I do, and speaking with friends in the field, it brings me joy to know I can chase an interest of mine and to take what I learn into a new career path. I have dabbled with freecodecamp prior to creating this pre-work to see if it is an interest I would like to stick with. My findings are almost unbelieveable. Hours can pass by and I won't even notice. When I was initially working on this pre-work, I started and was watching videos, learning more, and then next thing I knew the sun had gone down. Even seeing the most simple of things, <em> like changing how words looks</em> was cool, and exciting to see and gave me a feeling of accomplishment that I have not felt in a long time. This is why I want to learn, to change careers into an interest of mine rather than continuing to hit my head against a wall in a career that does not bring me the same joy. A better path is out there.

      <h2> Time in the Military</h2>
      <p>
         <b>The Beginning:</b> I joined the Georgia Army National Guard April 11th, 2012 while I was still in High school. The purpose of my joining the National Guard rather than the reserves was for college. I recieved the Georgia Military Scholarship through, at the time, North Georgia College and State University. I started as a 19D Cavalry Scout because it was the fastest OSUT that was not Infantry. I was shipped off June 25th, of 2012 to Fort Benning Georgia for an experience no one could pay me enough to relive.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Post OSUT:</b> I started school in January 2013 to pursue a criminal Justice degree. I wanted to work in law initially to make a difference in the community. During my time in school I continued to drill and accomplish my Summer Training. My unit had just returned from Kosovo when I joined, and so they were not up for another deployment until I finished college. When they were, the Georgia Guard decided it did not need another Cavalry unit, and dissolved it. Thus, turning it into an infantry unit. After a year and a half of trying to change MOS and being bounced around, I was moved to the last Cavalry unit in the state before finishing my time with the guard, and changing to the Army Reserves.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> Army Reserves: </b> I joined the Army Reserves because I thought being a paralegal and being in law is what I wanted to continue to do. I saw a position available for an e5 in Decatur and I took the chance. However, this is when Covid hit and I fell behind on my PT as well as the unit falling behind on my paperwork. I have been in a grey area ever since. Not out of the military, but also not in.
