    <h2 style="border:2px solid Violet;">About Me</h2>
   <p style="background-color:DodgerBlue;"> I was born and raised in Midtown Atlanta, more specifically Zone 6, and went through APS system. Played Football through highschool, and then Lacrosse through College. I did want to continue to play, but unfortunately the rugby team was more popular and took the school's already small funding. I enjoy listening to music and going to concerts. The most recent I went to was Earthgang right before the pandemic began to shut things down in 2020.  Ontop of concerts, I am a big Atlanta United fan. <em>(below is a picture of me at MBS in the throne)</em> Tailgates, marching in and sitting in the supporters section is an experience every sports fan should take the time to do. An amazing community, and a great party win or lose. I may of started as an FC Barca fan because of my grandmother, but my heart is here in Atlanta, and always will be. Even with a Pandemic, it has been an eventful two years. I lost my job because of cut backs, started as a line worker at a local brewery, started at a new law firm, left that firm for better pay, left that firm because the culture was not great, I got married<em>(pictured below is my wife and I)</em>, had to get a new car, and fed my other hobby of Video Games.  My friends and I still get together and sit outside at local breweries and continue to be as safe as possible. </p>

  <h3 style="border:2px solid Violet;"> Why I want to Learn Code</h3>
    </body>
  <body>
<p style="background-color:DodgerBlue;"> It is time for a change. Technology and coding has always been an interest of mine, but I doubted myself to be honest. It was my belief that going back to school would be the only way to make it happen, which I could not do financially. However, now knowing what I do, and speaking with friends in the field, it brings me joy to know I can chase an interest of mine and to take what I learn into a new career path. I have dabbled with freecodecamp prior to creating this pre-work to see if it is an interest I would like to stick with. My findings are almost unbelieveable. Hours can pass by and I won't even notice. When I was initially working on this pre-work, I started and was watching videos, learning more, and then next thing I knew the sun had gone down. Even seeing the most simple of things, <em> like changing how words looks</em> was cool, and exciting to see and gave me a feeling of accomplishment that I have not felt in a long time. This is why I want to learn, to change careers into an interest of mine rather than continuing to hit my head against a wall in a career that does not bring me the same joy. A better path is out there.</p>

      <h4 style="border:2px solid Violet;"> Time in the Military</h4>
    </body>
      <body>
          <p style="background-color:DodgerBlue;"> <b> The Beginning: </b> I joined the Georgia Army National Guard April 11th, 2012 while I was still in High school. The purpose of my joining the National Guard rather than the reserves was for college. I recieved the Georgia Military Scholarship through, at the time, North Georgia College and State University. I started as a 19D Cavalry Scout because it was the fastest OSUT that was not Infantry. I was shipped off June 25th, of 2012 to Fort Benning Georgia for an experience no one could pay me enough to relive.</p>
          <p style="background-color:DodgerBlue;"> <b> Post OSUT: </b> I started school in January 2013 to pursue a criminal Justice degree. I wanted to work in law initially to make a difference in the community. During my time in school I continued to drill and accomplish my Summer Training. My unit had just returned from Kosovo when I joined, and so they were not up for another deployment until I finished college. When they were, the Georgia Guard decided it did not need another Cavalry unit, and dissolved it. Thus, turning it into an infantry unit. After a year and a half of trying to change MOS and being bounced around, I was moved to the last Cavalry unit in the state before finishing my time with the guard, and changing to the Army Reserves.</p>
          <p style="background-color:DodgerBlue;"> <b> Army Reserves: </b> I joined the Army Reserves because I thought being a paralegal and being in law is what I wanted to continue to do. I saw a position available for an e5 in Decatur and I took the chance. However, this is when Covid hit and I fell behind on my PT as well as the unit falling behind on my paperwork. I have been in a grey area ever since. Not out of the military, but also not in.</p>
