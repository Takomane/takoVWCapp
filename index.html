    <h2>About Me</h2>
   <p> I was born and raised in Midtown Atlanta, and went through APS system. Played Football through highschool, and then Lacrosse through College. <br/>
        I did want to continue to play, but unfortunately the rugby team was more popular and took the school's Lacrosse funding. <br/>
     I enjoy listening to music and going to concerts. The most recent I went to was Earthgang right before the pandemic began to shut things down in 2020.<br/>
     Ontop of concerts, I am a big Atlanta United fan. <em>(below is a picture of me at MBS in the throne)</em> Tailgates, marching in and sitting in the supporters section is an experience every <br/>
     sports fan should take the time to do. An amazing community, and a great party win or lose. I may of started as an FC Barca fan because of my grandmother, but my heart is here in Atlanta, and always will be. <br/>
     However I have not been sitting around waiting for the chance to go out. I got married in November of 2021<em>(pictured below is my wife and I)</em>, and fed my other hobby of Video Games. <br/>
     My friends and I still get together and sit outside at local breweries and continue to be as safe as possible. Not to out myself as a snob, but I do maintain an untappd account. <br/>
     During the pandemic and when I lost my job at Seyfarth because of the pandemic, I started working in the back of house at Scofflaw brewing. To continue to make money, and <br/>
     stay on my feet. <em>(pictured below)</em> My main task was working on the line and when I switched to night shift I began working on filling Kegs. It was hard physical labor, <br/>
     but the free beer was worth it. So now we are here. </p>

  <h3> Why I want to Learn Code</h3>
  <body>
<p> It is time for a change. Technology and coding has always been an interest of mine. So far, I have built two of my own personal PCs, <br/>and to then learn how it all works and how computers read to get the information in front of us is what I want. <br/> I have dabbled with freecodecamp to see if it is an interest I would like to stick with, and even the most simple of things, <em> like changing how words looks</em> was cool, and exciting to see.<br/> This is why I want to learn, to change careers into an interest of mine rather than continuing to hit my head against a wall in a saturated and low rewarding career in law. <br> I have learned in my several years that a career in law is worth it if you are an attorney.</p>
