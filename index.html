    <h2>About Me</h2>
   <p> I was born and raised in Midtown Atlanta, and went through APS system. Played Football through highschool, and then Lacrosse through College. I did want to continue to play, but unfortunately the rugby team was more popular and took the school's Lacrosse funding. I enjoy listening to music and going to concerts. The most recent I went to was Earthgang right before the pandemic began to shut things down in 2020.  Ontop of concerts, I am a big Atlanta United fan. <em>(below is a picture of me at MBS in the throne)</em> Tailgates, marching in and sitting in the supporters section is an experience every sports fan should take the time to do. An amazing community, and a great party win or lose. I may of started as an FC Barca fan because of my grandmother, but my heart is here in Atlanta, and always will be. However I have not been sitting around waiting for the chance to go out. I got married in November of 2021<em>(pictured below is my wife and I)</em>, and fed my other hobby of Video Games.  My friends and I still get together and sit outside at local breweries and continue to be as safe as possible. Not to out myself as a snob, but I do maintain an untappd account.  During the pandemic and when I lost my job at Seyfarth because of the pandemic, I started working in the back of house at Scofflaw brewing. To continue to make money, and stay on my feet. My main task was working on the line and when I switched to night shift I began working on filling Kegs. It was hard physical labor, but the free beer was worth it. So now we are here. </p>

  <h3> Why I want to Learn Code</h3>
    </body>
  <body>
<p> It is time for a change. Technology and coding has always been an interest of mine. So far, I have built two of my own personal PCs, and to then learn how it all works and how computers read to get the information in front of us is what I want. I have dabbled with freecodecamp to see if it is an interest I would like to stick with, and even the most simple of things, <em> like changing how words looks</em> was cool, and exciting to see. This is why I want to learn, to change careers into an interest of mine rather than continuing to hit my head against a wall in a saturated and low rewarding career in law. I have learned in my several years that a career in law is worth it if you are an attorney.</p>

      <h4> Time in the Military</h4>
    </body>
      <body>
          <p> <b> The Beginning: </b> I joined the Georgia Army National Guard April 11th, 2012 while I was still in High school. The purpose of my joining the National Guard rather than the reserves was for college. I recieved the Georgia Military Scholarship through, at the time, North Georgia College and State University. I started as a 19D Cavalry Scout because it was the fastest OSUT that was not Infantry. I was shipped off June 25th, of 2012 to Fort Benning Georgia for an experience no one could pay me enough to relive.</p>
          <p> <b> Post OSUT: </b> I started school in January 2013 to pursue a criminal Justice degree. I wanted to work in law initially to make a difference in the community. During my time in school I continued to drill and accomplish my Summer Training. My unit had just returned from Kosovo when I joined, and so they were not up for another deployment until I finished college. When they were, the Georgia Guard decided it did not need another Cavalry unit, and dissolved it. Thus, turning it into an infantry unit. After a year and a half of trying to change MOS and being bounced around, I was moved to the last Cavalry unit in the state before finishing my time with the guard, and changing to the Army Reserves.</p>
          <p> <b> Army Reserves: </b> I joined the Army Reserves because I thought being a paralegal and being in law is what I wanted to continue to do. I saw a position available for an e5 in Decatur and I took the chance. However, this is when Covid hit and I fell behind on my PT as well as the unit falling behind on my paperwork. I have been in a grey area ever since. Not out of the military, but also not in.</p>
