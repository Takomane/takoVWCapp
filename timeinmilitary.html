  <h1> Time in the Military</h1>
  <body>
      <h2> The beginning</h2>
<p> I joined the Georgia Army National Guard April 11th, 2012 while I was still in High school. The purpose of my joining the National Guard rather than the reserves was for college. <br>I recieved the Georgia Military Scholarship through, at the time, North Georgia College and State University. I started as a 19D Cavalry Scout because it was the fastest OSUT that was not Infantry. <br>I was shipped off June 25th, of 2012 to Fort Benning Georgia for an experience no one could pay me enough to relive.</p>
<h2> Post OSUT </h3>
<p> I started school in January 2013 to pursue a criminal Justice degree. I wanted to work in law initially to make a difference in the community. <br>During my time in school I continued to drill and accomplish my Summer Training. My unit had just returned from Kosovo when I joined, and so they were not up for another deployment until I finished college. <br>When they were, the Georgia Guard decided it did not need another Cavalry unit, and dissolved it. Thus, turning it into an infantry unit. After a year and a half of trying to change MOS and being bounced around, <br>I was moved to the last Cavalry unit in the state before finishing my time with the guard, and changing to the Army Reserves.</p>
<h2> Army Reserves </h2>
<p> I joined the Army Reserves because I thought being a paralegal and being in law is what I wanted to continue to do (<em>which you can read about here <a href='Why-I-want-to-learn.html'>Why I want to Learn
    </a>.</em>). <br>I saw a position available for an e5 in Decatur and I took the chance. However, this is when Covid hit and I fell behind on my PT as well as the unit falling behind on my paperwork. <br>I have been in a grey area ever since. Not out of the military, but also not in.</p>
