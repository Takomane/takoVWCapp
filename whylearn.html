  <h1> Why I want to Learn Code</h1>
  <body>
<p> It is time for a change. Technology and coding has always been an interest of mine. So far, I have built two of my own personal PCs, <br/>and to then learn how it all works and how computers read to get the information in front of us is what I want. <br/> I have dabbled with freecodecamp to see if it is an interest I would like to stick with, and even the most simple of things, <em> like changing how words looks</em> was cool, and exciting to see.<br/> This is why I want to learn, to change careers into an interest of mine rather than continuing to hit my head against a wall in a saturated and low rewarding career in law. <br> I have learned in my several years that a career in law is worth it if you are an attorney.</p>
